#To anyone reviewing my code I submit to you a short summary of what ive 
#accomplished here and what ive struggld to accomplish here.
#First of all I would like you to focus on my new graphs in 'Final_ProjDF2.ipynb'
#in the results section of the experiment subfolder. Thats mainly what ive accoplished
# As for what i havent accomplished. merging the "Men" and 'Women' dataframes
# or 'M_Age_df' 'W_Age_df' in 'Final_Proj' and 'Final_ProjDF2 respectively. 
#Iv3e also been having problems resizing the new graphs ive made in 'Final_ProjDF2'
#Other then that makeing my ploting code more concise and helping me plot a pie
#chart.
